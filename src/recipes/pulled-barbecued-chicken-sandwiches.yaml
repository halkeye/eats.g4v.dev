title: Pulled barbecued chicken sandwiches
info: >
  The brand of barbecue sauce that you use can make a big difference in the
  flavor of the chicken. I like Sweet Baby Rayâ€™s!
directions:
  - >-
    Place chicken in the slow cooker. In a medium bowl, whisk together the
    barbecue sauce, Italian dressing, sugar and Worcestershire sauce. Pour the
    sauce over the chicken. Cover and cook on low for 4 1/2 to 5 hours.

  - >-
    Remove the chicken to a cutting board. In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and
    chicken broth. Stir it into the sauce in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on
    high until the sauce is thickened and heated through (10 to 15 minutes).
    Meanwhile, use two forks to shred the chicken. Return the shredded chicken to
    the slow cooker and stir. Add additional barbecue sauce if more sauce is
    needed or desired. Cover and continue cooking on low for 45 minutes. Serve
    chicken piled onto rolls. Add pickles, if desired.
