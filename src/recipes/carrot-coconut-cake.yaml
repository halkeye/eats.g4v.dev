title: Carrot Coconut Cake
info: >-
  The coconut flavor in this cake lends a little extra to the traditional carrot
  cake. This is the perfect-sized cake for a romantic dinner or even when you
  have a stop-by guest wanting a little tea and gossip. For some extra zip,
  toast some coconut flakes and use them to garnish the top of the cake after
  frosting.
directions: >-
  In a medium bowl, whisk together oil, sugar, egg, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla,
  carrot, coconut flakes, flour and baking powder. Do not overmix. Fold in
  pecans. Pour batter into a greased 6" cake pan.

  Pour water into the Instant Pot. Set trivet in pot. Place cake pan on top of
  the trivet. Lock lid.

  Press the manual button and adjust time to 20 minutes. When timer beeps, let
  pressure release naturally for 5 minutes. Quick-release any additional
  pressure until float valve drops and then unlock lid.

  Remove cake pan from the pot and transfer to a rack until cool. Flip cake onto
  a service platter.
