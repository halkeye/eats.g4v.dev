info: ''
directions: >-
  Add the onion and ONLY 1 cup of the broth to a large pan over medium to
  medium-high heat.

  Cook for about 8 minutes until the onion is very tender. (Add a tiny bit more
  broth if it is cooking too fast or turn the heat down, so the onions don't
  burn) 

  After 8 minutes, add the garlic and cook a couple of minutes more, stirring
  often. All of the broth should have evaporated by now. If not, keep letting it
  cook until the broth is GONE. You don't want any more liquid once it's done
  cooking, so the end result is thick and creamy.

  Add the cooked veggies (the onion and garlic) to a blender. 

  Start out by adding JUST 1/2 cup more of the remaining broth and add the
  remaining ingredients (salt, pepper, cashews, starting with JUST 1 tablespoon
  lemon juice, nutritional yeast-starting with just 2 tablespoons yeast). 

  Blend on high for a couple of minutes until very creamy and smooth. Add any
  more broth to reach desired consistency, if necessary. I did not. If you don't
  add more broth, you would likely not need any more yeast. 

  Taste and add any more salt & pepper or lemon, if desired.

  Serve over preferred pasta.
