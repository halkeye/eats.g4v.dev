  Combine all of the ingredients except the chocolate chips and shortening
  in a food processor. Process till smooth, scraping down the bowl once or
  twice if needed. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.

  Mix in 2 T. of chocolate chips (reserve the rest for dipping). Form into
  balls and freeze on a baking sheet till solid.

  Set a wire rack over a baking sheet covered with tin foil. In the top half of
  a double boiler set over barely simmering water, melt the remaining
  chocolate chips and shortening â€“ stir till smooth and remove from heat.

  Using a fork, dip one bite into the melted chocolate, turning till covered.
  Lift the bite out of the chocolate and tap gently on the side of the bowl to
  remove excess. Place on wire rack. Repeat with remaining bites. Return
  bites to freezer and freeze till solid.
