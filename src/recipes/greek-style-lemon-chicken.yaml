info: ''
directions: >-
  Place raw chicken in a bowl.

  Add all ingredients to the bowl.

  Mix. 

  Set aside for 1 hour.

  Heat a large pan on medium-high heat. 

  Add chicken to pan ensuring there’s enough room for each piece of chicken (as
  seen below) – no added oil needed since there’s olive oil in the marinade.

  Cover pan with lid and cook for 3-4 minutes.

  Flip each piece of chicken and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes uncovered.
