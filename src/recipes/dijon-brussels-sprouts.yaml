  Dijon Brussels sprouts are a perfect vegan holiday side featuring oven roasted
  brussels sprouts, olive oil, whole grain mustard, and maple syrup.

  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove the bottoms of the brussels sprouts then
  cut in half and add to a strainer. Wash the sprouts then add olive oil spray

  with a spatula to combine and add salt to taste if necessary. Serve
