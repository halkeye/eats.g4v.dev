  Heat oven to 450ยบ.

  Dry beans after rinsing on a paper towel.

  In a large bowl, combine ingredients to make the patties. You can also do this
  in a food processor (I normally would do this but my food processor stopped
  working as I was shooting this video).

  Chill patties in fridge for 30-45 minutes (or 15 minutes in freezer if you
  don't have time). Now is a good time to prepare toppings and fries.

  Bake patties and bacon for 20-30 minutes (I baked the fries at the same time).

  Assemble burgers and devour them
