title: Vegan Carrot Cake (& Frosting)
info: ''
directions: >-
  Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and grease a 9x13 baking pan.

  In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda,
  cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.

  In a separate bowl, whisk together the applesauce, almond milk, vanilla, sugar
  and oil.

  Mix the dry ingredients into the bowl with the wet ingredients.

  Fold in the carrots and stir until just combined.

  Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let
  cake cool completely before frosting.

  Make the frosting: combine all frosting ingredients into a high speed blender.
  Blend until very smooth for 1 to 2 minutes or more, scraping down the sides
  occasionally. You can add an extra tablespoon of almond milk if necessary to
  get your blade moving.

  Chill for at least 30 minutes before spreading. (It will firm up a bit).

  Store frosted cake in the fridge.
